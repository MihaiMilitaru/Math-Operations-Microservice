This project is a lightweight **Python microservice** built using **FastAPI**, providing a RESTful API for performing basic mathematical operations:

- Power (`pow`)
- Fibonacci (`n-th`)
- Factorial

All operations are persisted in a **SQLite** database. This is designed following **microservice best practices** and can be easily extended or containerized.
